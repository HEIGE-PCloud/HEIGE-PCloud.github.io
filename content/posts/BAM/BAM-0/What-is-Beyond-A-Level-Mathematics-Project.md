## Preface

I have been complaining about the course design of A Level Mathematics and Further Mathematics for quite a long time. The A Level syllabus is not "friendly enough" for students who are interested in pure mathematics. It teaches you the "algorithm" to work out the inverse of a matrix but never tells you why it is correct; it teaches you how to find the derivative of a function without strictly define the limit of a function. I understand that most of the questions I ask can be answered in some undergraduate courses. And this is part of the reason why I choose to do an undergraduate degree in maths. But I think the curiosity of maths question should never be restricted by the syllabus. I cannot wait until university lectures. I want to solve them now.

I believe some young mathematicians may have a similar feeling, but there will not be many of them. As far as I know, most students who choose to do A Level Maths and Further Maths are neither interested in a maths career nor the maths subject itself. They only need that A or A* to get an offer from an Economics or Computer Science department. At least in my college, I don't have any schoolmates to "discuss" maths problems. My friends do come to me to ask some maths questions, but I am more like a biological mark scheme generator instead of a discusser in that situation.

Finally, I come up with the idea of maintaining a project to record all of my questions and my answers to these questions based on the A Level Maths and Further Maths. I donâ€™t expect this project to be an influential one. But if you accidentally find it, I hope you enjoy it!

## What is Beyond A Level Mathematics Project?

The Beyond A Level Mathematics (BAM) project aims to answer some mathematical questions that A Level Maths and Further Maths students interested in but are not covered in the textbook.

The "beyond" does not mean that there will be a lot of content out of the A Level syllabus. There will still be a little of them because just too few things are covered within the syllabus. Instead, "beyond" means more mathematical thinkings and ideas are required to explore those topics. The BAM project is fully based on A Level Maths and Further Maths syllabus and will try very hard to avoid undergraduate content.

{{< admonition type=question title="Why avoiding undergraduate content?" open=true >}}
I have tried to write notes for undergraduate content before and find that at the end, I just wrote a trash Analysis or Linear Algebra textbook.
So if you interested in those topics, go ahead and read a **real** textbook, or maybe just consider doing a maths degree.

The BAM project can be and should be treated as an extension to the A Level Maths and Further Maths.

## Who is BAM Project designed for?

Most human beings do not read mathematical blogs for entertainment, so I don't expect thousands of readers from the beginning. But if you are one of the following types of people, you might find these posts quite interesting.

- Six form student who is very interested in mathematics and may decide to study maths in university.

Notice that the blog will involve all knowledge points in A Level Maths and Further Maths. So it assumes you have done all these already. But normal schools take two years to finish teaching all AS and A Level content. That's why you need to be "very interested in maths" and self-studies most of the content in advance.

- Maths teacher who what some extra teaching materials or maths problems and ideas for their students.

Similarly, you need to keep in mind that the blog will not follow your teaching progress and will assume all A Level content.

## How to make the best use of it?

For students
- I recommend you to read it on iPad/PC with a large screen or print it out. The mobile experience is not guaranteed, and there are **not** easy articles that you can read on your phone while queuing for lunch. Pen and paper are needed because there may have small or large questions for you to solve.
- Work through it.
- Have a brief look at extra readings, find interested ones to keep moving on.
- Leave a comment if you have any questions or just have something in your mind to share with others.

For teachers
- Extra reading materials for your students.
- Super curriculum. (reorganize it and explore the topic with students in lesson)
