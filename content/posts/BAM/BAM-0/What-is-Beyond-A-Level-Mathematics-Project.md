## Preface

I have been complaint about the course design of A Level Mathematics for quite a long time.

## What is Beyond A Level Mathematics Project?

The Beyond A Level Mathematics (BAM) project is aim to answer some mathematical questions which A Level Mathematics and Further Mathematics students may interested in but not being covered in the textbook.

It is fully based on A Level Mathematics and Further Mathematics Syllabus and will try very hard to avoid undergraduate content.

TODO: Why avoiding undergraduate content?
I have tried before and find that at the end I just wrote a trash Analysis textbook / Liner Algebra textbook
So if you really interested in it. Go and read a **real** Analysis / Linear Algebra textbook.

Things are not absolute. You may see admonitions like this one

It can be treated as an extension to the A Level syllabus.

## Who is the BAM Project designed for?

Well, most of the human beings do not read mathematical blog for entertainment. So I am not expecting thousands of readers.

- Six form student who is very interested in Mathematics and may decide to study math in university.

The blog will touch all knowledge points in A Level Mathematics and Further Mathematics. So it assume you have learned all these in advance or can learn something very fast.

- Maths teacher who what some extra teaching materials or maths problems and ideas for their students.

## How to make the best use of it?

For students
- View on iPad/PC or print out. The mobile experience is not guarantee. Pen and paper, may have small or large questions recommend to solve.
- Work through it. and have a brief look at extra readings, find interested ones to keep moving on. Or go on to the next one.
- Leave a comment if you have any questions or just have something in your mind to share with others.

For teachers
- Extra reading materials
- Super curriculum (reorganize it and explore the topic with students in class)

## What is the pricing?

All blogs are licensing under CC 4.0

Free for education

No commercial use (You can reprint and distribute it for free and attach the link to the original page, but you cannot sell it)

You can still make a donation by BTC so that I can buy more maths books (They are so expensive) and produce more content.
